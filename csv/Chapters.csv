According to CNBC, wage growth has been consistent with an inflation rate of 4.5% while many consumer prices have increased by 9.1%. Americans are feeling the brunt of inflation especially at the grocery stores, gas stations, and with rent payments. This results in more citizens being on government assistance programs like food stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). <br> <br> The US Department of Agriculture reported that prices for food at home rose 11.4% in 2022. An increase like this has not been seen since the 1980s. Rising food prices impact consumers with lower incomes who spend a large portion of their earnings on food. This will likely mean that many households will become more reliant on SNAP and have limited access to nutritious foods. <br> <br> North Carolina is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States with an annual growth rate of 1.9%. With more people moving to North Carolina, the demand for goods will rise, hence, so will the cost. Let's take a look at SNAP participation rates by different demographic groups by county in North Carolina.",6,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.1418315,-82.5024911,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
North Carolina (NC) SNAP Participation Rates,media/snaprates.png,,,"Based on the figure above, White and Black or African American populations have the highest participation rates in SNAP, although, their distribution is somewhat different. For White populations, there is a heavy reliance on SNAP in the coastal and mountain regions of North Carolina. Conversely, for Black or African American populations, there is a heavy reliance in the southwest part of the Piedmont region. For both white and black communities, the central Piedmont region is where we observe the highest participation in SNAP. <br> <br> Percentage rates are not always the best way to quantify the total amount of people who participate in SNAP. Therefore, let's take a look at the total number of households participating in SNAP by different demographic groups.",6,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.1418315,-82.5024911,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
NC Participation in SNAP by Household,media/totalhouseholds.png,,,"This map highlights how Black or African-American households have the highest participation in SNAP. Specifically, Mecklenburg County has the highest participation as more than 25,000 Black or African American households participate. According to the NIH, <q> Black populations have experienced higher rates of food insecurity when compared to other populations in the United States. </q> This explains why we observe this higher value. Let's take a closer look at Mecklenburg County.",6,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.1418315,-82.5024911,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
Mecklenburg County ,media/meckcountyhouseholds.png,Image Source: Wikipeadia,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Agnes_Hospital_%28Raleigh,_North_Carolina%29","The figure displays how no other demographic group exceeds 10,000 participating households besides Black or African-American households. This is a big discrepancy. Among all racial groups, Black or African American households are second most likely to experience poverty and therefore more reliant on government assistance programs. This cycle is reinforced by labor market discrimination which forces Black people into less advantageous roles where they have less access to stable jobs, good wages, and retirement benefits. <br> <br> A key way to break this cycle is by having access to educational resources that properly prepare people for higher education. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ?workers with higher levels of education, <q> typically earn more and have lower rates of unemployment compared with workers who have less education. </q> ",11,Hidden,,Mecklenburg County,35.2577908,-81.1338535,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
Poverty Rates and Educational Attainment,media/povertyrates_edu.png,,,"The map above shows poverty rates by county for people with varying levels of education.

,media/corr4.png,,,"To quantify the relationship between educational attainment and SNAP participation, I used the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. For non-high school graduates, high school graduates, and associate degree holders we observe a strong positive correlation ( > 0.61). This indicates when having an associate-level education or below, there is a strong likelihood that the household will be dependent on SNAP.<br> <br> Strangely, we observe a Pearson Correlation Coefficient value of 0.4 between bachelor's degree holders and participation in SNAP. This indicates a moderate, positive correlation. According to Self, <q> Since 1984, graduate salaries have decreased by 10.6% after considering inflation, falling from the equivalent of $68,342 in 1984 to $64,840 for the class of 2022.</q> Salaries today cannot support the rising cost of living resulting in more households relying on SNAP.

Median Household Income by NC Counties,media/medianincome.png,,,"This map displays the median household income by county in North Carolina. As we can see, Wake, Union, and Mecklenburg County have the highest median income. This result is contradictory to the SNAP figures above. While Mecklenburg County has some of the highest earnings a large number of households participate in SNAP. This indicates there could be income disparity within Mecklenburg County. <br> <br> Next let's take a look at the educational institutions (primary, secondary, and collegiate institutions) in North Carolina.",6,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.1418315,-82.5024911,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
Colleges and Public Schools in NC,media/colleges_schools_meck.png,,,"As we can see, the Mecklenburg (183) and Wake (201) counties have the highest number of schools. This is a reasonable result as these counties have the highest populations within the state, 1,145,392 and 1,175,021 respectively.",11,Hidden,,Wake County,35.7975006,-78.9540434,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
Mecklenburg County Schools,media/meck_schools.png,,,"According to NCES, <q> districts with high-income households have more to spend on public education. </q>This is evident in the map of Mecklenburg County above as they have the second highest amount of schools in the state and a higher median household income as compared to other NC counties.",11,Hidden,,Mecklenburg County,35.2577908,-81.1338535,,0.9,geojson/North_Carolina_State_and_County_Boundary_Polygons.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
Conclusion,,,,"In conclusion, we observed that Black or African American households in Mecklenburg County are most dependent on SNAP. Additionally, getting a four-year college degree is no longer as profitable as it once was. There are still several households that rely on SNAP despite being college graduates. Finally, Mecklenburg County may not have enough educational institutions that can support its population resulting in increased reliance on government assistance programs. Everyone deserves to live in a prosperous area, and hopefully, this research can raise awareness of the educational and income disparities within North Carolina.
