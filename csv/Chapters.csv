The Rising Cost of Living,wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iStock-1361391451-scaled.jpg,Source: Raleigh Government,https://www.aces.edu/,"The cost of living is drastically rising. According to CNBC, wage growth has been consistent with an inflation rate of 4.5% while many consumer prices have increased by 9.1%. Americans are feeling the brunt of inflation especially at the grocery stores, gas stations, and with rent payments. This results in more citizens being on government assistance programs like food stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
 The US Department of Agriculture reported that prices for food at home rose 11.4 percent in 2022. An increase like this has not been seen since the 1980s. Rising food prices impact consumers with lower incomes who spend a large portion of their earnings on food. This will likely mean that many households will become more reliant on SNAP and have limited access to nutritious foods.
 North Carolina is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States with an annual growth rate of 1.9%. With more people moving to North Carolina, the demand for goods will rise, hence, so will the cost. Let's take a look at SNAP participation rates by different demographic groups by county in North Carolina.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/51816/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,
North Carolina (NC) SNAP Participation Rates,media/peace.jpg,Image Source: Niche,https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-peace-university/,"Based on the figure above, White and Black or African American populations have the highest participation rates in SNAP, although, their distribution is somewhat different. For White populations, there is a heavy reliance on SNAP in the coastal and mountain regions of North Carolina. Conversely, for Black or African American populations, there is a heavy reliance in the southwest part of the Piedmont region. For both white and black communities, the central Piedmont region is where we observe the highest participation in SNAP.
Percentage rates are not always the best way to quantify the total amount of people who participate in SNAP. Therefore, let's take a look at the total number of households participating in SNAP by different demographic groups.",16,Plain,blue,15 E PEACE ST,35.7882396,-78.6373757,,,,
